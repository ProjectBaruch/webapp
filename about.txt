      In March 2000 the Zicklin School opened the Subotnick Financial Services Center, an exciting state-of-the-art instructional facility that integrates hands-on financial services practice into the business curriculum. The Subotnick Center is one of the few business school resource of its kind in New York and one of a handful of comparable facilities at top educational institutions nationwide. Its centerpiece is the Bert W. and Sandra Wasserman Trading Floor, a fully equipped, simulated trading environment featuring 55 high-end workstations, real-time market data feeds, and financial analytics tools. Professional market technology is used to provide experiential learning opportunities where students learn about markets and financial services - valuable experience for graduates seeking leading positions in the financial, banking, or accounting services industries. The Center also features a 60-seat seminar room and a 25-seat software development laboratory.
